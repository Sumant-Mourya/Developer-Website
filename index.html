<h1>Privacy Policy for Recline</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Recline ("we", "our", or "the app") is a phone dialer application developed by Sumant Mourya.
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is used and protected when you use our app.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recline processes most data locally on your device. Some limited data may be collected
        by third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics, as described below.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Fake Call Feature</h2>
    <p>
        The Fake Call feature allows you to simulate an incoming call for personal use.
        Fake calls are generated locally on your device using a foreground timer service.
        They do not contact real phone numbers, emergency services, or external systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature is clearly labeled within the app and is intended for entertainment or
        privacy purposes only.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Recline operates primarily as an offline application. We do not collect, transmit,
        or store your personal data on any external servers.
    </p>
    <p>The app accesses the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contacts</strong> – To display contact names, phone numbers, and photos during calls and in the contact list</li>
        <li><strong>Call Logs</strong> – To show your recent call history and allow editing or deleting call records</li>
        <li><strong>Phone State</strong> – To manage incoming and outgoing calls and display caller information</li>
        <li><strong>SMS</strong> – To send auto-reply and quick reply messages when those features are enabled by you</li>
        <li><strong>Photos / Media</strong> – To allow you to select custom background images for the call screen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        None of this data is transmitted to our servers or to any third party by the app itself.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Call Audio</h2>
    <p>
        Recline is a default phone replacement app that integrates with Android's Telecom framework
        (<code>InCallService</code>). Call audio — including your microphone — is managed entirely
        by the Android system during phone calls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recline does <strong>not</strong> record, store, process, or transmit any call audio.
        No audio is saved locally or shared with any server or third party.
        The app only controls call UI, routing (earpiece / speaker / Bluetooth), and mute state
        via system APIs.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Crash Reporting – Firebase Crashlytics</h2>
    <p>
        Recline uses <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>, a crash reporting service provided by Google,
        to help us identify and fix stability issues.
    </p>
    <p>Crashlytics may automatically collect the following information when a crash or error occurs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crash stack traces and error logs</li>
        <li>Device model, OS version, and app version</li>
        <li>Anonymised device identifiers</li>
        <li>App state at the time of the crash (diagnostics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is used solely to diagnose and fix bugs. It is not linked to your personal identity
        and is governed by Google's Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Advertising – Google AdMob</h2>
    <p>
        Recline uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display native and banner advertisements.
        Google AdMob may collect certain information as described in Google's Privacy Policy,
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID</li>
        <li>Device information (model, OS version)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data collection is governed by Google's Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            https://policies.google.com/privacy
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Ad Display Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Advertisements are <strong>never</strong> shown during active phone calls, on incoming call
        screens, or over the lock screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Native ads appear briefly when you access certain features in app settings, with a cooldown
        between displays. Banner ads appear in select configuration screens.
        Ads are only shown when you actively interact with features and can be closed at any time.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Recline requests the following permissions, each used solely for the stated purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone &amp; Call</strong> – Make, receive, and manage phone calls as a default dialer</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts</strong> – Display caller and contact information</li>
        <li><strong>Call Log</strong> – Show, edit, and delete recent call history</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – Incoming call, missed call, and ongoing call alerts</li>
        <li><strong>SMS (Send only)</strong> – Send auto-reply and quick reply messages</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> – Route call audio to Bluetooth headsets</li>
        <li><strong>Write Settings</strong> – Set a custom system ringtone chosen by you</li>
        <li><strong>Storage / Media</strong> – Select custom background images for the call screen</li>
        <li><strong>Internet</strong> – Load advertisements and send crash reports</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service</strong> – Keep the call screen and fake call timer active</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using Android SharedPreferences
        and internal app storage. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Call background images and preferences</li>
        <li>Sleep control schedules and contact exceptions</li>
        <li>Call blocking rules and auto-reply messages</li>
        <li>Quick reply message templates</li>
        <li>Theme and customisation preferences</li>
        <li>Ad cooldown and display counters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can clear all app data at any time via
        <em>Settings → Apps → Recline → Clear Data</em>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. Data may be shared only as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – Device and ad interaction data for serving advertisements</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> – Anonymised crash and diagnostic data for stability improvements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other data is shared with any third party.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Recline is not directed at children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data
        through a third-party SDK (such as AdMob or Crashlytics), please contact us at the
        address below.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect data stored on your device.
        Since all app data remains local, security depends on your device's system protections
        such as lock screen, encryption, and OS-level app sandboxing.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
        Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
</div>
