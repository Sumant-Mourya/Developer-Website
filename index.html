Privacy Policy for Recline
Last updated: February 25, 2026
Introduction
Recline ("we", "our", or "the app") is a phone dialer application developed by Sumant Mourya. This Privacy Policy explains how information is used and protected when you use our app.

Recline processes most data locally on your device. Some limited data may be collected by third-party services such as Google AdMob and Firebase Crashlytics, as described below.

Fake Call Feature
The Fake Call feature allows you to simulate an incoming call for personal use. Fake calls are generated locally on your device using a foreground timer service. They do not contact real phone numbers, emergency services, or external systems.

This feature is clearly labeled within the app and is intended for entertainment or privacy purposes only.

Information We Collect
Recline operates primarily as an offline application. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any external servers.

The app accesses the following data locally on your device:

Contacts – To display contact names, phone numbers, and photos during calls and in the contact list
Call Logs – To show your recent call history and allow editing or deleting call records
Phone State – To manage incoming and outgoing calls and display caller information
SMS – To send auto-reply and quick reply messages when those features are enabled by you
Photos / Media – To allow you to select custom background images for the call screen
None of this data is transmitted to our servers or to any third party by the app itself.

Call Audio
Recline is a default phone replacement app that integrates with Android's Telecom framework (InCallService). Call audio — including your microphone — is managed entirely by the Android system during phone calls.

Recline does not record, store, process, or transmit any call audio. No audio is saved locally or shared with any server or third party. The app only controls call UI, routing (earpiece / speaker / Bluetooth), and mute state via system APIs.

Crash Reporting – Firebase Crashlytics
Recline uses Firebase Crashlytics, a crash reporting service provided by Google, to help us identify and fix stability issues.

Crashlytics may automatically collect the following information when a crash or error occurs:

Crash stack traces and error logs
Device model, OS version, and app version
Anonymised device identifiers
App state at the time of the crash (diagnostics)
This data is used solely to diagnose and fix bugs. It is not linked to your personal identity and is governed by Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Advertising – Google AdMob
Recline uses Google AdMob to display native and banner advertisements. Google AdMob may collect certain information as described in Google's Privacy Policy, including:

Advertising ID
Device information (model, OS version)
IP address
Ad interaction data
This data collection is governed by Google's Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob.

Ad Display Policy
Advertisements are never shown during active phone calls, on incoming call screens, or over the lock screen.

Native ads appear briefly when you access certain features in app settings, with a cooldown between displays. Banner ads appear in select configuration screens. Ads are only shown when you actively interact with features and can be closed at any time.

Permissions
Recline requests the following permissions, each used solely for the stated purpose:

Phone & Call – Make, receive, and manage phone calls as a default dialer
Contacts – Display caller and contact information
Call Log – Show, edit, and delete recent call history
Notifications – Incoming call, missed call, and ongoing call alerts
SMS (Send only) – Send auto-reply and quick reply messages
Bluetooth – Route call audio to Bluetooth headsets
Write Settings – Set a custom system ringtone chosen by you
Storage / Media – Select custom background images for the call screen
Internet – Load advertisements and send crash reports
Foreground Service – Keep the call screen and fake call timer active
Data Storage
All settings and preferences are stored locally on your device using Android SharedPreferences and internal app storage. This includes:

Call background images and preferences
Sleep control schedules and contact exceptions
Call blocking rules and auto-reply messages
Quick reply message templates
Theme and customisation preferences
Ad cooldown and display counters
You can clear all app data at any time via Settings → Apps → Recline → Clear Data.

Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. Data may be shared only as follows:

Google AdMob – Device and ad interaction data for serving advertisements
Firebase Crashlytics – Anonymised crash and diagnostic data for stability improvements
No other data is shared with any third party.

Children's Privacy
Recline is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data through a third-party SDK (such as AdMob or Crashlytics), please contact us at the address below.

Security
We take reasonable measures to protect data stored on your device. Since all app data remains local, security depends on your device's system protections such as lock screen, encryption, and OS-level app sandboxing.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
